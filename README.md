# 🏠 Chennai House Price Prediction  

## 📘 Overview  
This project predicts **house prices ** based on their **size (in sq.ft)** using a simple **Linear Regression model**.  
It demonstrates the use of Python libraries like **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn** for data analysis and machine learning.

📊 Output
*Scatter plot showing House Size vs House Price.
*Red line = Predicted Price trend.

🌟 Future Improvements
*Add more features (like location, number of rooms, etc.).
